the category of data I would like to access is the 'MW1' column, containing numbers with certain weather conditions observed at the time of recording.
there are multiple numbers that indicate observations of freezing rain ('25', '47', '48', '54', '55', '56', '64', '65', '66').
my goal is to firstly, gather all of the observations in the 'MW1' column, and then aggregate all of the times that those freezing rain occurrences appear.

ideally, i would like to know how many times all of these occurrences ring up, and a secondary goal would be to find if any freezing rain observations occur 3 times in a row.
